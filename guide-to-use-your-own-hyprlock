if you don't wanna use my hyprlock and wanna use your own then here is what you are supposed to do.


go to your hyprlock.conf and find something like,


background {
    monitor     =
    path        = $wallpaper

    blur_passe...

}

you need comment the background line or just remove this entire block.
that's quite it...
