if you don't wanna use my hyprlock and wanna use your own then here is what you are supposed to do.

go to your hyprlock.conf and find something like,


background {
    monitor     =
    path        = screenshot

    blur_pass = 0 <---- no other value

}

you need to set the path to screenshot and set blur_pass = 0
